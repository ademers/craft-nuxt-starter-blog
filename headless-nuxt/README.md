# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

We recommend to look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

:warning: If you're running Craft in a Nitro local development environment, port 3000 may not be available. If so, start the development server on a different port. For example:

```bash
PORT=5001 npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/docs/deployment).
